ASP.NET Core MVC, ASP.NET Core Razor Pages, Dependency Injection, Entity Framework Core, SQL Server, CRUD Operations.

This NidhisBookStore application is made in ASP.NET Core MVC in Visul Studio Community 2019 software where I added three projects, NidhisBooks.DataAccess, NidhisBooks.Models, and
NidhisBooks.Utility along with the readme.txt file where I detailed readme for this web application process.

Then added Razor pages, dependancy injections, Entity Framework Core, views, controllers for Category, CoverType and Product features.
Then made migrations for all of three with validations for all three tables.

Make CRUD operations for Category, CoverType and Product tables through which Create, Edit, Update, and Delete operations could be possible.

Final output could be seen to the homepage of the application..
